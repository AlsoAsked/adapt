***code-distortion/adapt*** is a package for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) that *builds databases for tests*.

It unifies the process of building databases, to help you get the most out of them.



## Features

- Adapt is a [swap-in replacement](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/usage/) for Laravel's `RefreshDatabase`, `DatabaseMigrations`, and `DatabaseTransactions` traits.
- It [creates your test databases](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/building-a-database/) for you. You don't need to beforehand.
- Databases are [reused between tests](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/reusing-databases/) within the *same test-run*, and are also reused *the next time you run your tests* - no start-up delay (regardless of whether you're running parallel tests or not).
- Introduces a new (experimental) [journaling method](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/reusing-databases/#journaling) for reusing databases, as an alternative when [transactions](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/reusing-databases/#transactions) can't be used, like when browser testing.
- Databases are [checked before re-use](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/reusing-databases/) to make sure they were left in a clean state - for example if the transaction a test is wrapped in gets committed during a test, the database won't be clean. It will be rebuilt.
- Incorporates your [seeders](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/building-a-database/#seeders) into its caching system. Different tests can use different seeders without causing the database to be rebuilt each time.
- Changes to your migrations, seeders and factories are detected, and [databases are automatically rebuilt](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/building-a-database/#rebuilding-your-database) the next time they're needed (no need to specify `--recreate-databases` manually). Handy when changing branches.
- Supports [parallel testing](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/parallel-testing/) by creating separate databases for each process.
- Include [Dusk browser tests](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/browser-testing/) as a normal test-suite (no need to run `php artisan dusk` separately). They can also be run in *parallel!*
- It's got you covered if your project [has more than one database](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/building-a-database/#building-extra-databases) - you can specify extra databases to build, along with their own migrations and seeders.
- If you have two or more Laravel codebases in your project (e.g. when using a microservices architecture, or implementing the Strangler Fig Pattern), it may be useful for one of them to build test-databases for the other/s. Adapt supports this via [remote building](https://code-distortion.net/packages/adapt/remote-databases/#building-databases-remotely).
- No need to update your test `setUp()` methods.
